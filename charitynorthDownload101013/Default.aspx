    <p>Dear Sirs;</p>
    <p>Learning a new skill is rewarding, and when applied to projects, learning new processes is usually required.&nbsp; I have the ability to assess a situation and come up with a plan of action, quickly. Please review my portfolio, on the menu at left. A quick scan of my resume shows that I have delivered projects in several industries and in a variety of roles. Be it as a developer, analyst or project manager,&nbsp; I have the experience to be immediately productive.</p>
    
    <p>Flexibility is key. Today’s markets are fast changing. To thrive in an environment of change an organization must be ready to respond. One must be ready to capitalize on changing conditions by executing planned responses. I am a certified project manager (PMP), with experience in a variety of environments, as well as, taught all knowledge areas of project management at the college level. </p>

    <p>Use me to code or to manage your projects as needed.</p>
    <p>Mike Lanham, PhD, PMP</p>
