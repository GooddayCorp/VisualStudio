    So 
    who am I? I am fascinated by systems. I know, I know, you say, &quot;What????? 
    'systems', how boring!&quot;, but hold-on, much of the cool stuff in nature and 
    technology breaks-down to the interactions of the pieces of a bigger thing, a 
    system. Systems have parts that interact; 
    these interactions can make life interesting (<a href="systemfundamentals.aspx?<%=Request.QueryString%>">more 
    about systems</a>). There is a philosophy of life 
    that proclaims that a person is wise who 
    can keep a childlike wonder about the world. I aim to keep that wonder (<a href="ExampleSystem.aspx?<%=Request.QueryString%>">example 
    of an amazing system</a>).</p>
    <p>The delicate balance of the basic forces of nature creates the Universe 
    we know. Understanding these principles is a great joy. I am a life long 
    learner.</p>
    
    <h4 class="heading" >Balance is essential.</h4>
    <p>Balance is achieved through 
    a synthesis of mind, body and spirit. These parts of being human compose a 
    system with the interplay and feedback that is generally inherent in systems. The 
    results are often as surprising as any observed elsewhere in nature.</p>
    <p>
    The 
    intellectual understanding of nature is fun, but  the 
    physical part of being human must be recognized as well. Health and fitness are important. 
    To keep the animal fit whether a horse, a dog or a man, a significant part 
    of each day should be devoted to vigorous physical activity. In Bellingham, 
    Washington there are great trails (<a href="http://www.ridegalbraith.com/AboutGalbraith.cfm">RideGalbraith</a>). 
    This geography provides the opportunity to mountain bike 
    on single track trails (<a href="BlanchardHill.htm">Blanchard Hill</a>).&nbsp; Riding 
    trails deep into the forest, feeling, hearing and smelling the natural 
    world, challenges the body while refreshing the spirit. The frequent crashes 
    make the 'feeling' a little hard at times, but the scratches and bruises are 
    are a small price for the healing smell of pine and the soothing sound of 
    wind in the trees.</p>
    <p>
    The 
    third part of the human system is the spirit. A good spirit can be 
    cultivated, and the act of cultivation produces good feelings. This cycle of 
    good begetting good is an important feedback process of the human system. 
    Spirituality is personal; as such, one should proclaim one's own beliefs, in 
    humility and not pass judgment on another's beliefs. I understand that some 
    would disagree and claim to have received instructions directly from a 
    higher power. Even so, humility is essential to grow in good spirit. We 
    should refrain from proclaiming that our beliefs are superior to another 
    persons. Having stated that, it is good and could be helpful to others to 
    confess one's beliefs. I believe that we each must find a purpose to be happy. I have chosen to believe that the purpose of 
    life is to grow the density of goodness of the Universe. This, I believe, is 
    done by accepting other individuals as they are, by embracing the goodness 
    in one’s self and by helping others recognize the goodness in themselves. 
    Simply, to be nice and not nasty, to help others feel good. My choice of 
    purpose is not to the exclusion of a higher power. To the question of 
    the existence of a higher power, I must, 
    in humility, confess that I don’t have the answer. I will admit that I am biased 
    toward a belief in God by my early childhood upbringing. In 
    fact, I have chosen, as an adult, to believe in Goodness (<a href="purpose.aspx?<%=Request.QueryString%>">more 
    on my beliefs</a>).</p>

    <img border="0" src="../Images/rockclimbing.jpg" width="205" height="194" float="left" align="left" class="pictureleft">Balancing the
    sometimes opposing drives of being human- body, mind and spirit is challenging. 
    Facing this challenge is necessary to grow in goodness. Life’s challenges, 
    our experiences, make us or break us. I choose to be made better by these 
    challenges. (<a href="interestsspecific.aspx?<%=Request.QueryString%>">special
