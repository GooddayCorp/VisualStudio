    <div class="clink" style="text-align:center">Goodness is Universal. The Universe 
      is Good.<br>
      Goodness is the Spirit of the Universe. The Spirit of the Universe is 
      Good.<br>
      Goodness is the Purpose of the Universe. The Purpose of the Universe is 
      Good.<br>
      The purpose of existence is to grow the density of Goodness: <br>
      By accepting others as they are, <br>
      By embracing the Goodness in one’s self, <br>
      And by helping others recognize the Goodness in themselves. <br>
      That is, to help others feel Good, by being nice and not being nasty.<br>
      Thank Goodness for this amazingly rich Universe, filled with potential, 
      finely balanced, such that an incredible variety of phenomenon exist; 
      including stars that shine by the fusion of protons, producing both light 
      and the light elements.<br>
      When stars are depleted, if massive enough, they can implode with such 
      violence that they become supernova, fusing the light elements into heavy 
      elements and spewing stardust into the cosmos; where it condenses to form 
      new generations of stars, with planets.<br>
      Planets are concentrations of stardust, heated from within by fission of 
      the unstable elements produced in Supernova and heated from without by 
      fusion of protons, in the stars that they orbit.<br>
      This heat stirs the elements; when atoms of complementary electron 
      structure collide they can bond, forming molecules. And molecules react 
      with other molecules. The products of which depend on the environment, 
      that is, temperature, pressure and the other molecules present.<br>
      The condition that the molecules produced depend on the molecules present, 
      and the molecules present are produced by those same reactions sets up 
      feedback, stabilizing the environment preferential for certain molecular 
      species.<br>
      A system that responds to the environment and replicates itself has the 
      essence of life, and life begets life. More and more complex life forms 
      evolve until sentience arises, that is the ability to sense and respond, 
      and intelligence arises, that is, the ability to process information and 
      make choices, and consciousness arises, that is, the ability to be aware 
      of one’s self and have freewill. Freewill makes love possible. Love is 
      that transcending emotion that gives meaning to life.<br>
      I am so very grateful for all the love that I have been given in this 
      life, especially by women. Thank Goodness, women have taught me to love. 
      They are precious and deserve lives filled with goodness and joy. I am 
      saddened that I was unable to provide what they needed to feel Good. <br>
      But, I have faith that I will grow stronger in good spirit, and the 
      ability to love unconditionally, without the need to control or the fear 
      of rejection. I pray to the Almighty for help to transform my reactive 
      energy into loving actions that brings Goodness to those that I touch 
      daily.<br>
      Finally, thank Goodness for a healthy body capable of enjoying the carnal 
      pleasures of this animal existence and a healthy mind capable of 
      appreciating all the blessing that I have received.<br>
      For all of these things I am humble grateful. Thank you Almighty Goodness, 
      Amen.<br>
