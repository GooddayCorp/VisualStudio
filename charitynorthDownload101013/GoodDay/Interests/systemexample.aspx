    <h4 class="heading" >Earth-Moon System.</h4>
    <p>The Earth-Moon System is an elegant example of the amazing consequences 
    of the parts of a system interacting. This system is about as simple as one 
    can imaging: two bodies isolated in space, with only one force acting 
    between them, gravity. One would not expect anything interesting from such a 
    simple system. Yet, the fact that we exist is strong evidence that this 
    system is not as simple as one might expect. </p>
    <p>The 
    forces imposed on the Earth-Moon system by the Sun are much weaker than the 
    force acting between these two bodies. Therefore, for the sake of this 
    discussion, we can neglect the effects of the Sun and all other external 
    forces on this system and treat the Earth/Moon as a closed system. However, 
    someday in the far, far future this will not be the case, as the following 
    discussion will reveal.</p>
    <p>The 
    result of the gravitational force between the Earth and the Moon are the 
    tides. The tides cause deformation of the solid part of both bodies and of 
    course the oceans of the Earth. The Earth spins on its axis and the Moon 
    orbits the Earth. Both the spinning and orbiting are expressions of angular 
    momentum. Like a spinning wheel these bodies tend to spin at a constant rate 
    unless some force acts on them. This is a basic characteristic of nature. A 
    body in motion will remain in motion unless an outside force acts on it 
    (Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Law). The energy of motion, in this case the energy 
    of spinning is gradually being dissipated. The tides are gradually using the 
    energy of spinning to break down rocks on the beach, to move sand, to make 
    frictional heat, and to produce internal heat and friction inside the Earth 
    and Moon. This
    <a href="http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=124">
    loss of the spinning energy</a> is measurable. The Earth’s spin is slowing 
    down (0.002 seconds/century), the days are getting longer and the Moon is 
    gradually moving away from the Earth (3ft/century), the months are getting 
    longer!</p>
    <img align="right"  alt="Spinning Earth" src="http://static.newworldencyclopedia.org/7/70/Rotating_earth_%28small%29.gif"/>
    <p>Ages ago (3-4 billion years) the Moon was much closer to the Earth 
    (<a href="http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=699">19-30 
    thousand km</a> compared to the current 384 thousand km) and the tides 
    were stupendous. Imagine the Moon 4,000 times closer than it is today, and 
    the days were only 18 hours long! Do you think that the full Moon is 
    impressive today? Think of what it would have looked like then! Wow!</p>
    <p>&nbsp;Another result of the interaction of the Earth and Moon is that the Moon has 
    lost all of its spin. The tides within the Moon have dissipated the 
    rotational energy to the final state; the same side of the Moon always faces 
    the Earth. In addition, one can predict the final state of the Earth/Moon 
    system- the day and the month will be equal at 1320 hours, or 55 today days 
    long. The Earth/Moon system is changing as a result of the two system 
    components, the Earth and the Moon, interacting with each other, as is true 
    of most systems. Amazing!</p>
    <p>
    There 
    are many amazing consequences resulting from the interaction of 
    the components of this system. The Earth/Moon system is spectacular considering 
    the relative sizes of these two bodies. The Earth/Moon system is really a 
    binary planet. In fact, these two celestial bodies orbit each other (around 
    a point about
    <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/moon">
    4670 km</a> from the Earth's center). As a result of the Moon’s huge size 
    and the small distance between the Earth and Moon, the ocean tides on Earth 
    <img class="pictureleft" src="../Images/moonrisingfull4c.jpg" alt="Full Moon Rising over Atlantic." align="left" width="206" height="329" />are very large; these tides create a broad high energy, transition zone 
    between the water-breathing world and the air-breathing world, that is, 
    thousands of miles of beaches. These beaches present a very challenging 
    environment for life on Earth. This zone tests new adaptations of life on 
    Earth. An ocean creature being beached or isolated in a brackish tide pool 
    faces a tremendous challenge to life. Only a few live, those gifted with 
    the ability to survive exposure to air, drying heat and direct sunlight. 
    There is little doubt that having this large, hugely challenging environment has sped up 
    biological change on this planet. Thank goodness for a big Moon! A wise man 
    never looses a childlike wonder of the the world.</p>
