    <p>Dear Sirs;</p>
    <p>
		I have the experience to be immediately productive. 
      A quick scan of my resume shows that I have managed a variety of 
      projects.&nbsp; Today’s markets are fast changing. To thrive in an environment 
      of change an organization must be ready to respond. One must be ready to 
      capitalize on changing conditions by executing planned responses.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The heart of any 
      enterprise is its people. I will coordinate your resources to fulfill the 
      needs and expectations of all stakeholders. The initial step toward 
      success is to explicitly state those needs. The final step is to fulfill 
      the stakeholder expectations.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The challenges of 
      coordinating multiple teams, in a fast paced environment is rewarding. I 
      am ready to apply my experience to your business.</p>
      <p>Mike Lanham, PhD, PMP</p>
      <p>p.s.<br />
    While I am primarily a project manager, not a 
    coder, the purpose of this website is two fold- to demonstrate my technical 
    abilities, as well as, my project management expertise. As such, I 
    show JavaScript, VBscript and .ASP functionality beyond the HTML that is 
    required for this simple site. I have built several websites over the years, 
    one of which was a project for a Seventh Day Adventist radio station, KLRF. 
    This site is no longer up, but I have published a copy on this platform. The
    <a class="clinks" href="http://www.charitynorth.com/subsites/klrf/index.asp?<%=Request.QueryString%>">KLRF</a>  website  
    has registration, authentication, style sheets, site search, personalization cookies, Paypal 
    donation, java mail and searchable database functionality; these are core 
    features of 
    business websites (<a class="clinks"
