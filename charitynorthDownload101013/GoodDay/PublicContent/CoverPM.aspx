    <p>Dear Sirs;</p>
    <p>
		I enjoy coding; particularly, learning new technologies to better fulfill project 
      requirements.&nbsp; Please review my portfolio on the menu at left. A quick scan of my resume shows that I have 
      delivered projects in serveral industries and in a variety of roles. Be it as a 
      developer or a management consultant,&nbsp; I have the experience to be immediately productive.</p>
          <p >
            Flexibility is key. Today’s markets are fast changing. To thrive in an environment 
      of change an organization must be ready to respond. One must be ready to 
      capitalize on changing conditions by executing planned responses. I am a 
            certified project manager (PMP), with experience in a variety of environments, as well as, taught all knowledge 
            areas of project management at the college level. </p>
         
      <p>Use me to code or to manage your projects as needed.</p>
      <p>Mike Lanham, PhD, PMP</p>
