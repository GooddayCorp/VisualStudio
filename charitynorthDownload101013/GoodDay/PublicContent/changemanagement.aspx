      Dear Sirs;<br /><br />
      <p>
      Every business wants to maximize the productivity of its employees. It is 
      risky to state absolutes, but with regard to productivity there are few, 
      if any, legitimate exceptions to this rule. It is worth repeating, every business 
      wants to maximize the productivity of its employees. A quick scan of my 
      resume shows that I have managed a variety of projects. I have the 
      experience to be immediately productive. Today's markets 
      are fast changing. To thrive in an environment of change an organization 
      must be ready to respond. One must be ready to profit from change by 
      executing planned responses. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Do you want profits? The hard reality is that risk taking is necessary in 
      today's business environment. A manager who takes risk, makes waves. Take 
      Carl Icahn for example, he is infamous for rocking the boat, but as his 
      success shows, rocking the boat is necessary to get it off the sandbar, to 
      get a business profitable again. To emulate his success one must demand 
      good data. Many chief executives have asked, &quot;How did I get into this 
      situation?&quot; The answer, 
      while not pleasant, is simple: &quot;You are not getting accurate data!&quot; 
      It is understandable why staff hedges; the politically astute will tell 
      you what they think you want to here. The survival instinct is 
      particularly strong in the management ranks, being smart is, after all, 
      how they rose to management. It takes 
      courage to standup in front of your peers and your boss to speak the 
      truth. It is surely a way to make a target of yourself, not a good way to 
      stay whole. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Some, in high places, have recently stated that corporate 
      executives are &quot;stupid&quot;. A better take on the situation is that, it is 
      very hard to make smart business decision when the data you are given is 
      corrupt. Is your organization stuck? Do you want to get back into the 
      rapid business currents? If so, sponsor change; count on me to help bring 
      a fresh perspective to your business. If given the 
      mandate, I will be a fulcrum of change.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
      The heart of any enterprise is its people. I will coordinate your resources to fulfill the 
      needs and expectations of all stakeholders. The initial step toward success is to explicitly 
      state those needs. The final step is to fulfill the stakeholder expectations.
      </p>
      <p>
      The challenges of coordinating multiple teams, in a fast paced environment is rewarding. I am 
      ready to apply my experience to your business.
      </p>
      <p>
      Thank you for considering me for this position.<br/>
