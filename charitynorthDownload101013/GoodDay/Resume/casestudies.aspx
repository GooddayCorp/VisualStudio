      CASE STUDY:</b><br />
      <br />
      <div class="clinks">
      The following is a professional situation I managed. In this project, I 
    worked with a team of IS professionals at <a href="http://www.lilly.com/">Eli Lilly</a> to develop a website on 
    schedule. The Lilly IS organization was challenged by this project. My skill 
    as the project manager created a better outcome than would have occurred 
    without my efforts. I managed the client and coordinate a matrix of 
    stakeholders. This successful outcome required taking risks to get the job 
    done.<br />
      <br />
      During the <a href="http://www.lillyGenesis.com">
      LillyGenesis.com</a> Project, I 
      led the development team to build a website for the <a href="http://www.humatrope.com">Humatrope</a> product 
      line. The challenge was, as is often the case with software projects, that the Humatrope product managers did not 
    understand the scope of effort required for the project. That is, they did 
    not know exactly what they wanted, nor did they know the resources required 
    for successful completion. Consequently, requirements were constantly 
    changing. There were challenges both with the scope of the project and the 
    infrastructure needed to deliver what the client wanted. The crux of the 
    project was to deliver a website with patient charting functionality that 
    medical practitioners could use online, in their offices.<br />
      <br />
      I took many risks during this project to manage the client's expectations 
    and to leverage the client's influence within the Eli Lilly organization. I 
    used the client to apply pressure on the infrastructure group to get support 
    for the charting tool we were using. The end product was an on-time delivery 
    of the website that met the client's needs, but everyone had to work 
    overtime to get the job done.<br />
      <br />
      <b>
      Case Study, Part 2:</b><br />
      During the lillyGenesis.com project that I describe above, I was also 
    managing projects for the Lilly Women's Health Program. Under the umbrella 
    of the Women's Health Program several small IT projects needed done. One 
    project was the web enabling of a grant application form, another project 
    was the building of an online survey and a third project was the 
    miscellaneous maintenance of the Women's Health website. In order to get all 
    these projects completed on time and within budget, I used one development 
    team. The efficiency of using one team to do all these projects made it 
    possible to complete all the sub-projects.<br />
      <br />
      Each of these activities was funded by a different source. Consequently, I 
    had to maintain separate cost controls. I took risks in authorizing 
    resources to work on this many projects at one time. There was a risk of 
    misunderstanding the scope of the projects, and there was a risk of poor 
    tracking of the hours for each project. Despite the complexity of working on 
    multiple projects, we got the job done on time and within budget.<br />
      <br />
      I feel that both the Women's Health Program and the lillyGenesis.com 
    Project turned out better than they would have, had I not coordinated these 
    activities.<br />
      <br />
      Thank you for considering me for this position.<br />
